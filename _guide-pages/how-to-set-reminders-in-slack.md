# **What** is Slack?

Slack is a communication and collaboration platform that organizes conversations into topics, groups or private messages. Each topic or group is called a Channel. Hack for LA uses slack to allow teams to connect, discuss and work on projects collectively. There are channels set up for both specific projects, and specific functional roles.
