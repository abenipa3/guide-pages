# Hack for LA Website's Guide Pages Prototype

## Project Overview
Guide Pages are "How-To" documentations on various technologies that will help users tackle their tasks used in Development, Design, Project Management, or Professional Development. It is also a section where Hack for LA consistently maintain and post new guides when the team discover team technologies that would be used to the civic tech software community. There are currently [several guide pages](https://www.hackforla.org/toolkit/) available on Hack for LA's live website and Google Docs (view only).

However, there are visual errors on the Guide Pages, and publishing new guides is not user-friendly for maintainers without development background. With the help of Hack for LA's Guides and Website Teams, I took the initiative to redesign and develop the Guide Pages from scratch with Jekyll and JavaScript to make it visually impactful and feasible for maintenance and updates.
